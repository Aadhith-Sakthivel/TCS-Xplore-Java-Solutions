Question 8 :

Create a Class Player with below attributes:

id - int
country - String
side - String
price - double

Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required. 

Create class Solution with main method. 

Implement static method - searchPlayerForMatch in Solution class.

This method will take a String parameter along with the other parameter as array of Player objects. 
The method will return array of Player where the String parameter appears in the side 
attribute (with case insensitive search).

This method should be called from main method and display the id of returned objects in ascending order. 

Before calling this method(searchPlayerForMatch) in the main method, use Scanner object to read 
values for four Player objects referring the attributes in the above sequence. then, read the value for search parameter. 
Next call the method searchPlayerForMatch, write the logic to sort the id in ascending order (in main method) and display the result. 

Consider below sample input and output:

Input:
1
India
Batting
2500000
2
Australia
Batting
1000000
3
Srilanka
Bowling
1700000
4
England
Bowling
2000000
Batting

Output:
1
2

--------------------------------------------------
Sample code snippet for reference:
Please use below code to build your solution.
--------------------------------------------------

public class Solution
{

public static void main(String[] args)
{
//code to read values
//code to call required method
//code to display the result
}

public static Player[] searchPlayerForMatch(String search, Player[] players)
{
//method logic

}
}

class Player
{
//code to build Player class
}

-------------------------------------------------

Note on using Scanner object:
Sometimes scanner does not read the new line character while invoking methods like nextInt(), nextDouble() etc. 
Usually, this is not an issue, but this may be visible while calling nextLine() immediately after those methods.

Consider below input values:
22
hello

Referring below code:

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int x = sc.nextInt();
String str = sc.nextLine(); -> here we expect str to have value hello. Instead it may be "".

If above issue is observed, then it is suggested to add one more explicit call to nextLine() after reading numeric value.
